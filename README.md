an safe box system on the platform of Arduino. 
Designed by Horan

Type in the password to open the box, if force open the 3-axis sensor and the LDR sensor will work and send the alarm to a remote terminal through Zigbee devices and the buzzer on the remote terminal will go off. Built a database to deposit the records of every operation on the safe box (the exact time it is opened), using Arduino Yun to realize the connection between the safe box and the web page, every time you open the box, Arduino Yun will send out a message to the database.
